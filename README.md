# CS 0w0: Introductory data science

## Course overview and learning goals

This course is designed with the intention of familiarizing the student(s) with the most commonly used tools in data science for a variety of applications in science and engineering. While there are weekly lectures, the student(s) will primarily learn through weekly assigned exercises that make use of Python, GitHub, and LaTeX, and scientific Python libraries including NumPy, SciPy, and scikit-learn. We also include a brief overview of common terminology used in data science, such as optimization, sampling, and bootstrapping. By the end of the course, students should be able to skim online resources related to data science and programming as well as tool documentation for their specific application need.

## Course structure
- Weekly lectures
    - 2 hours via Google Hangouts, to schedule at regular intervals
    - Interactive office hours included
    - Basic guided programming exercises included where necessary
- Optional reading to do after lecture
- Weekly problem sets/programming exercises
    - 4 hours
    - To be submitted through Github

## Course material
In-class and take-home exercises are posted through Jupyter notebooks or available as Python scripts. They are numbered by week and will be all available in this Github folder. Towards the end of the course, we will tackle basic LaTeX typesetting and math mode, where the choice of TeX editor is up to you.
